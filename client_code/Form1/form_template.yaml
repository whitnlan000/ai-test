      Welcome to Anvil's drag-and-drop designer. Let's use it to make this page interactive!

      1. Go to the toolbox on the right (or click **Add Components** on small screens)

      2. Choose the **Filled Button** and drag it onto this page.

      3. Now let's make it do something. Click on the button you just placed, and select `on click event ->`.
          You're now in Anvil's code editor.

      4. Write some code to change the text on the button when it's clicked!
          (Example: `self.button_1.text = "Clicked!"`)

      5. Click the **Run** button in the top right.
